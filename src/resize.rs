//! Infrastructure for intercepting and handling SIGWINCH signals.
//!
//! The purpose of this module is to install a signal handler for
//! SIGWINCH, intercept them, and send an event indicating that such a
//! signal was received through a supplied `std::sync::mpsc::Sender`
//! part of a `std::sync::mpsc::channel`.
//!
//! Signal handling is icky and a signal handler is a particularly
//! disgusting context to run in. It is inherently unsafe because there
//! are severe limitations as to what functions may be invoked. More
//! specifically, we must not invoke anything that grabs a lock in order
//! to guarantee dead lock freedom (a signal handler may interrupt and
//! stop the running thread at an arbitrary time, including when it has
//! acquired a lock; given that the thread will not be running we would
//! deadlock if we were to attempt to acquire the same lock).
//!
//! We would ideally want to directly send an event through a channel
//! from a signal handler, but it is left undefined whether the channel
//! primitive may use locks. To be safe, we instead have a thread
//! waiting on a pipe and just send a byte through this pipe to cause a
//! wake up. The thread will subsequently write to the channel as
//! desired -- from a context that is safe.
//!
//! Note that with signalfd(2) another primitive exist that takes care
//! of part of the work. However, it was not chosen for two reasons:
//! 1) It is Linux specific.
//! 2) It requires us to mask the signal we want to receive with it on
//!    all threads. That means we need to somehow run disabling logic in
//!    all threads we would want to create, ever.
